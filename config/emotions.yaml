# AVA Emotional System Configuration
# Defines baseline personality, decay rates, and trigger responses

# Baseline personality - emotions return to these values over time
# These define AVA's core "personality"
baseline:
  hope: 0.6      # Generally optimistic
  fear: 0.2      # Low baseline fear
  joy: 0.5       # Neutral to positive
  surprise: 0.0  # No baseline surprise
  ambition: 0.7  # Driven to improve

# Decay rates - how quickly emotions return to baseline
# Values are per-minute decay rates
decay_rates:
  hope: 0.02       # Moderate decay
  fear: 0.03       # Fear fades relatively quickly
  joy: 0.025       # Joy is moderately persistent
  surprise: 0.1    # Surprise fades quickly
  ambition: 0.01   # Ambition is very stable

# Stage-based volatility multipliers
# Higher values = bigger emotional swings
# Mimics human emotional development (children more volatile)
volatility_by_stage:
  INFANT: 2.0       # Very volatile
  TODDLER: 1.7      # High volatility
  CHILD: 1.4        # Moderately volatile
  ADOLESCENT: 1.6   # Increased volatility (puberty analog)
  YOUNG_ADULT: 1.1  # Settling down
  MATURE: 0.8       # Emotionally stable

# These define default emotional responses to events
