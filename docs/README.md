Welcome to the **AVA** project! 🎉

AVA (Afsah's Virtual Assistant) is an advanced AI initiative aimed at creating a personalized, **semi-sentient modular AI system**. Inspired by sophisticated AI concepts like JARVIS and grounded in cutting-edge research, AVA integrates **neurosymbolic cognition**, an **ensemble architecture**, and **layered cognitive processing** (simulating intuitive, analytical, and meta-aware thought).

The goal is to develop an efficient, adaptable, and ethically-aligned virtual assistant capable of complex reasoning, task automation, and human-like interaction, moving beyond traditional virtual assistants towards a more cognitive AI.

## 📚 Research Foundation

This project is built upon the conceptual framework detailed in the accompanying research paper:

**AVA: A Semi-Sentient Modular AI System with Neurosymbolic Cognition and Ensemble Architecture**

> **[Read the Full Research Document Here]([AVA_Research.md])** 👈 *Replace this link with the actual path or URL to your research document (e.g., in the `docs/` folder or an external link).*

The paper outlines the core architectural principles, including:
-   **Modular Ensemble Design:** Using a compact base model combined with specialized expert models, managed by a Mixture-of-Agents (MoA) meta-controller.
-   **Cognitive Layering:** Implementing Systems 0 (Meta-Awareness), 1 (Intuitive Processing), and 2 (Analytical Reasoning).
-   **Neurosymbolic Computation:** Bridging neural pattern recognition with symbolic reasoning, inspired by cortical simulation.
-   **Ethical and Metacognitive Framework:** Incorporating self-modeling capabilities and robust, multi-layered ethical safeguards.
-   **Optimization Strategies:** Utilizing techniques like quantization for efficient deployment.

## 🌟 Core Features

-   **Personalized Task Automation**: Automates daily tasks based on personal routines and preferences.
-   **Voice and Text Command Interface**: Interact with AVA via text or voice commands.
-   **Modular Ensemble Architecture**: Leverages a base model and domain-specific expert models routed by an MoA controller for enhanced accuracy and capability.
-   **Layered Cognitive Processing**: Simulates dual-process thinking (System 1 & 2) and meta-awareness (System 0) for more nuanced responses.
-   **Neurosymbolic Integration (Goal)**: Aims to combine neural learning with symbolic reasoning for deeper understanding and explainability.
-   **Ethical & Metacognitive Framework**: Designed with self-awareness mechanisms and integrated ethical safeguards.
-   **Integration with APIs**: Seamless connection with various external APIs (weather, calendar, etc.).
-   **Cross-Platform Support**: Designed to operate across different operating systems.
-   **Efficiency Focused**: Utilizes optimization techniques like model quantization (`llama.cpp` based) for reduced resource consumption.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

-   **Python**: Core programming language for backend logic and AI model integration.
-   **Bash / Batch Scripting**: For system-level task automation.
-   **Docker**: Containerization for consistent deployment and testing environments.
-   **Ollama**: Utilized for running local language models efficiently (as referenced in research).
-   **Node.js**: Potential frontend development for interactive interfaces.
-   **Rust**: Potentially used for high-performance data processing modules (as suggested in research).
-   **YAML**: Configuration management.
-   **AI/ML Frameworks**: Libraries like Transformers, PyTorch/TensorFlow, `llama-cpp-python`.
