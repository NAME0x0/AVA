**Vision:** To build AVA (Afsah's Virtual Assistant) as a compact, powerful, and locally-run agentic AI model capable of serving as a daily driver for advanced tasks. This project focuses on deploying AVA on an **NVIDIA RTX A2000 GPU with 4GB VRAM**, emphasizing performance, robust agentic capabilities, and a seamless user experience via both command-line and graphical interfaces, including remote access.

## About This Repository

This repository contains the conceptual framework, architectural design, research insights, and development roadmap for Project AVA. The primary goal is to create a transformative AI that can perform complex agentic tasks, understand context deeply, and operate efficiently on resource-constrained consumer hardware.

AVA development leverages a multi-layered strategy, including:
*   Ultra-efficient base model architectures (e.g., Gemma 3n series).
*   Aggressive 4-bit quantization (`bitsandbytes`).
*   Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) like QLoRA (`trl`, `unsloth`).
*   Strategic knowledge distillation.
*   Sophisticated agentic architectures (function calling, tool use, advanced reasoning).
*   Model Context Protocol (MCP) for direct data access.
*   Optimized user interfaces (CLI and GUI using Open WebUI).
*   Robust remote access capabilities (secure tunneling, token streaming).

## Project Goals 🎯

*   **Develop a High-Capability Local AI:** Create an AI agent that is "more advanced than current frontier LLMs" in specific agentic tasks, despite its small footprint.
*   **Optimize for 4GB VRAM:** Ensure AVA can run effectively on an NVIDIA RTX A2000 with 4GB VRAM through aggressive compression and efficient fine-tuning.
*   **Enable Advanced Agentic Tasks:** Implement function calling, versatile tool use, structured output, and robust reasoning mechanisms.
*   **Provide Seamless User Experience:** Offer both a powerful CLI and an intuitive GUI (based on Open WebUI).
*   **Facilitate Remote Access:** Allow AVA's local inference capabilities to be accessed remotely via secure token broadcasting.
*   **Foster Discussion & Collaboration:** Encourage contributions and discussions around building powerful, local AI systems.
