# AVA System Architecture - Visual Overview (v6 - Conceptual)

This document provides a conceptual visual representation of the AVA v6 ("Quantum & Neuro-Synergistic Apex") architecture. Due to the immense complexity and multi-dimensional nature of AVA, this diagram is a simplified, layered abstraction intended to illustrate the relationships between major components.

**Key:**
* `==>` / `<==` / `<==>`: Major data/control flow
* `-->` / `<--` / `<-->`: Internal component interaction or data flow
* `(...)`: Notes or sub-components

## Layers and Key Interactions Explained:

1.  **External World / User Interface:** The entry and exit point for all interactions with AVA. This includes natural language, APIs for programmatic access, and potentially direct sensor input or actuator control if AVA interfaces with physical systems.

2.  **Unified Perception & Creation (Multimodal Fusion):** This layer handles the initial processing of all incoming data from various modalities and the final generation of outputs. It translates diverse inputs into a common internal representation for the cognitive core and renders internal representations into rich, multimodal outputs. Neuromorphic pre-processing for sensor data happens here.

3.  **Strategic Orchestration Core (Meta-Controller):** The central "brain" or conductor of AVA.
    * It receives processed input/queries from the Perception layer.
    * It performs high-level planning, task decomposition, and resource allocation.
    * It decides which agents (MoA), experts (MoE), tools, or backbone capabilities to engage.
    * It leverages quantum-assisted planning for highly complex scenarios.
    * It manages the "Sleeptime Compute" resources for background tasks.
    * It monitors overall system performance and initiates meta-reasoning or re-planning if necessary.
    * It sends generation requests back to the Perception/Creation layer.

4.  **Collaborative & Reasoning Nexus (MoA³):** A dynamic collection of specialized AI agents that perform complex reasoning, problem-solving, and collaborative tasks.
    * Receives tasks from the Meta-Controller.
    * Agents (Generalist, Neuro-Symbolic, Process-Supervised, Formally Verifiable) collaborate, critique, and refine solutions.
    * Interacts heavily with the Tool Ecosystem and the Core Backbone for information and computation.

5.  **Specialization & Skill Matrix (MoE³):** A vast array of highly specialized expert models and algorithms.
    * Activated by the Meta-Controller or specific agents to perform fine-grained tasks or provide specialized knowledge/computation (e.g., a neuromorphic expert for a specific pattern, a quantum-inspired algorithm for an optimization sub-problem).
    * Relies on the Core Backbone for underlying computational power.
    * Subject to lifecycle management (evolution, pruning) by the Principled Evolution Engine via Sleeptime Compute.

6.  **Core Cognitive Backbone (Hybrid Transformer-SSM):** The fundamental engine for sequence processing, representation learning, and large-scale computation.
    * Provides the massive context window and core processing power for all higher-level functions (MoA, MoE, Meta-Controller).
    * Integrates classical (Transformer/SSM) and quantum-hybrid co-processors.
    * Its dynamic neural topology allows for structural adaptation over time.

7.  **Extended Cognition (Tool Ecosystem):** Provides AVA with access to external knowledge, real-world data, and specialized functionalities not built into its core.
    * Used by agents (MoA) and potentially the Meta-Controller.
    * Subject to self-expansion and federated learning.

8.  **Principled Evolution Engine:** Drives AVA's continuous learning, adaptation, self-improvement, and adherence to its ethical constitution.
    * Receives feedback from all layers (user interactions, agent performance, tool usage, internal monitoring).
    * Implements Constitutional AI, RLHF/RLAIF, PRMs, and active curriculum learning.
    * Guides the AI-Driven Scientific Discovery Cycle and manages self-improving data pipelines.
    * Many of its intensive processes utilize "Sleeptime Compute."

9.  **Sleeptime Compute Resources:** An underlying pool of computational capacity managed by the Meta-Controller for non-real-time, intensive background tasks essential for AVA's long-term growth and optimization (e.g., training reward models, evolving experts, large-scale data analysis, active discovery experiments).

## Limitations of this Diagram

* **Static Representation:** This diagram is static, while AVA is envisioned as an extremely dynamic and adaptive system.
* **Dimensionality:** It is difficult to represent the richness of connections and the multi-layered interactions in a 2D textual format. Many components have connections to multiple other components not explicitly drawn as direct lines to maintain clarity.
* **Scale:** The sheer number of experts, agents, and the complexity of their interactions are hard to convey visually here.
* **Feedback Loops:** While implied, the intricate feedback loops between all layers (especially to the Evolution Engine and Meta-Controller) are simplified.

This visual overview should be used in conjunction with the detailed [STRUCTURE_VISION.md](./STRUCTURE_VISION.md) document (once renamed) for a fuller understanding of the AVA v6 architecture.
