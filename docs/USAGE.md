# AVA Usage & Potential Applications ðŸ’¡

This document outlines how to use AVA, your local agentic AI daily driver, and its potential applications, all optimized for an NVIDIA RTX A2000 (4GB VRAM).

Refer to `[INSTALLATION.md](./INSTALLATION.md)` for setup and `[UI_CONNECTIVITY.md](./UI_CONNECTIVITY.md)` for interface details.

## Core Interaction Modes

AVA is designed for versatile interaction to suit various user needs and workflows:

1.  **Command Line Interface (CLI):**
    *   **Best for:** Developers, advanced users, scripting, automation, quick tasks.
    *   **How to use:** Open your terminal and use `ava [command] [arguments]`.
    *   **Example Interactions:**
        *   `ava query "What is the weather in London?"` (Leverages function calling with a weather tool)
        *   `ava execute_code python "print('Hello from AVA')"` (If a code execution tool is integrated)
        *   `ava summarize_file --path "./meeting_notes.txt"` (Requires MCP integration for file access and a summarization agentic workflow)
        *   `ava schedule --task "Call John at 10 am tomorrow" --calendar "personal"` (Tool use with a calendar API)
        *   `ava --prompt "Draft an email to the team about the project update."` (General text generation)
    *   **Output:** Can be plain text, structured JSON (for scripting), or streamed responses.

2.  **Graphical User Interface (GUI - via Open WebUI):**
    *   **Best for:** Conversational interaction, exploring AVA's capabilities, users preferring a visual interface.
    *   **How to use:** Access the self-hosted Open WebUI instance in your browser.
    *   **Example Interactions (within Open WebUI chat):**
        *   Typing natural language queries: "Can you find research papers on 4-bit quantization for LLMs published after 2022?" (Leverages web search tool, reasoning)
        *   Requesting AVA to perform actions: "Generate a Python script to parse a CSV file and output a summary." (Leverages code generation tool, structured output)
        *   Utilizing custom knowledge collections (if configured in Open WebUI) for domain-specific questions.
        *   Interacting with advanced agentic UI features (e.g., seeing tool execution logs, interactive code blocks if implemented).

3.  **Remote Access:**
    *   **Best for:** Using AVA when away from the local machine, accessing AVA from different devices (phone, tablet, other computers).
    *   **How to use:** Connect to the secure public URL generated by the tunneling service (e.g., `Localtonet`) from any browser or compatible client.
    *   **Experience:** Similar to using the GUI, with token streaming ensuring responsive interaction.

## Key Applications & Use Cases for AVA (Optimized for 4GB VRAM)

AVA's strength lies in performing complex *agentic* tasks locally by efficiently using its optimized model and external tools. It aims to be "more advanced" in these specific workflows rather than general knowledge breadth of larger models.

*   **Smart Information Assistant:**
    *   **Contextual Web Search & Summarization:** Fetching and summarizing information from the web based on complex queries, using integrated search tools.
    *   **Local Document Q&A (via MCP):** Answering questions about local documents (text files, PDFs if parsing tool integrated) by directly accessing them through MCP.
    *   **Real-time Data Retrieval:** Providing current information (weather, stocks, news) via API tool calls.

*   **Development & Coding Assistance:**
    *   **Code Snippet Generation:** Creating small, targeted code snippets in various languages.
    *   **Simple Code Explanation/Debugging:** Helping understand or find issues in small blocks of code (relies on fine-tuning).
    *   **Boilerplate Generation:** Creating outlines for files, functions, or project structures.
    *   **(Ambitious) CLI Command Generation/Execution:** Translating natural language to shell commands and (with user approval) executing them.

*   **Productivity & Task Management:**
    *   **Personalized Reminders & Calendar Management:** Interacting with calendar APIs to set reminders, schedule meetings, and query agendas.
    *   **Automated Note-Taking/Summarization:** Summarizing provided text or (with MCP) local files.
    *   **Drafting Communications:** Assisting in writing emails, messages, or simple reports based on prompts and context.

*   **Custom Automation Workflows:**
    *   **Scriptable Agentic Tasks:** Using the CLI to chain AVA's capabilities for automated sequences (e.g., fetch data from an API, process it, then draft a summary).
    *   **Personalized Knowledge Organization:** Using AVA with MCP to interact with a personal, local knowledge base of files.

*   **Learning & Exploration:**
    *   **Interactive Problem Solving:** Working through problems step-by-step with AVA's CoT reasoning.
    *   **Exploring Technical Concepts:** Asking AVA to explain concepts, potentially drawing on its fine-tuned knowledge or web search capabilities.

## Maximizing AVA's Potential on Constrained Hardware

*   **Focus on Agentic Strengths:** Leverage AVA for tasks that benefit from its ability to use tools, reason, and process information in a structured way, rather than as a general knowledge oracle.
*   **Task-Specific Fine-tuning:** The more AVA is fine-tuned (via QLoRA and synthetic data) for specific types of agentic tasks, the better it will perform.
*   **Optimize Prompts:** Clear, well-structured prompts are crucial for guiding AVA, especially given its smaller size.
*   **Leverage MCP:** Utilize the Model Context Protocol for direct file and data access to reduce reliance on the LLM's internal knowledge and improve factual grounding.

AVA aims to be a powerful daily driver by being smart about *how* it works, combining an efficient local LLM with a robust agentic framework and seamless connectivity.
