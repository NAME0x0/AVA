# AVA Installation & Setup (Conceptual)

**Disclaimer:** Project AVA, particularly its v6 "Quantum & Neuro-Synergistic Apex" architecture, is a highly advanced and theoretical framework. A full local installation of AVA as described is not currently feasible due to its immense complexity, resource requirements (including quantum and neuromorphic hardware), and reliance on future technological breakthroughs.

This document provides conceptual guidance on how one might approach setting up components or simulations related to AVA research, and how tools like Ollama *might* play a role in running *highly simplified, conceptual parts or specific expert models* in the distant future, not the entire AVA system.

## Conceptual Tiers of "Running AVA"

1.  **Full AVA v6 System:**
    * **Requirements:** Access to next-generation supercomputing clusters, scalable quantum-hybrid computing resources, advanced neuromorphic hardware, petabytes of data, and a massive, specialized software stack.
    * **Installation:** This would involve a distributed deployment across multiple specialized hardware platforms, managed by a sophisticated orchestration system (the Meta-Controller). It's beyond the scope of individual or typical institutional installation.
    * **Status:** Purely theoretical at present.

2.  **Simulating AVA Components or Sub-systems:**
    * **Goal:** To research, develop, and test individual modules of AVA (e.g., a new MoE routing algorithm, a specific type of neuro-symbolic agent, a quantum-assisted planning module in simulation).
    * **Requirements:** Powerful classical workstations or GPU clusters, specialized simulation software for quantum/neuromorphic components (if applicable), relevant ML frameworks (PyTorch, JAX), and datasets for the specific component.
    * **Installation:** This would involve setting up complex development environments, installing multiple libraries, and configuring simulation parameters. Instructions would be highly specific to the component being researched.

3.  **Running Individual (Classical) Expert Models or Simplified Agents (Conceptual Future with Ollama):**
    * **Context:** In a distant future where some of AVA's *classical, less complex* expert models or agent architectures might be distilled or adapted into more manageable forms.
    * **Ollama's Potential Role:** Ollama allows users to easily run various open-source large language models locally. If specific, self-contained classical AI models derived from AVA research (e.g., a specialized summarization expert, a basic reasoning agent *without* the advanced MoA collaboration or quantum features) were to be packaged in a compatible format (like GGUF), Ollama *could* theoretically be a way to run these individual pieces.
    * **This is NOT running AVA.** It would be like running a single neuron and calling it a brain. AVA's power comes from the synergistic interaction of its vast, heterogeneous components.

## Conceptual Installation Steps for Ollama (for running *hypothetical future AVA-derived classical models*)

This section is purely speculative and assumes such models become available and compatible.

1.  **Install Ollama:**
    * Follow the official Ollama installation instructions for your operating system (Linux, macOS, Windows) from [https://ollama.com](https://ollama.com).

2.  **Acquire an AVA-Derived Model (Hypothetical):**
    * If a compatible model file (e.g., `ava-expert-text-v0.1.gguf`) were released, you would download it.
    * You would also need a `Modelfile` that defines how Ollama should run this model, specifying parameters, templates, etc.

3.  **Create the Model in Ollama:**
    * Using the Ollama CLI:
        ```bash
        ollama create ava-expert-text-v0.1 -f ./Modelfile_ava_expert_text_v0.1
        ```
        (Where `Modelfile_ava_expert_text_v0.1` is the definition file you created or obtained).

4.  **Run the Model:**
    * Using the Ollama CLI:
        ```bash
        ollama run ava-expert-text-v0.1 "Your prompt for the expert model"
        ```

## Key Considerations for AVA-Related Development Environments (Simulations/Components)

* **Version Control:** Git is essential for managing code, configurations, and research.
* **Environment Management:** Use tools like Conda or Docker to manage complex dependencies for different components.
* **ML Frameworks:** PyTorch and JAX are likely candidates for core AI development.
* **Specialized SDKs:** For quantum (Qiskit, Cirq, etc.) and neuromorphic (Loihi SDK, SpiNNaker tools, etc.) component simulation or hardware interaction.
* **Data Management:** Tools for handling and versioning large datasets.
* **Access to Compute:** Significant GPU resources are a minimum for serious component research. Access to HPC clusters, cloud AI platforms, or prototype quantum/neuromorphic hardware would be needed for more advanced work.

## Conclusion

Installing and running the full AVA v6 system is a futuristic concept. Current efforts would focus on researching and simulating its individual innovative components. Tools like Ollama might, in the future, serve as a convenient way to run specific, simplified classical models that *could* emerge from the broader AVA research initiative, but they would not represent AVA itself.

For now, "installation" in the context of Project AVA primarily refers to setting up advanced research and simulation environments to tackle the foundational challenges outlined in [AVA_Research.md](./AVA_Research.md) and [DEVELOPMENT.md](./DEVELOPMENT.md).
