# Contributing to AVA

First off, thank you for considering contributing to AVA! Your help is essential for making AVA a powerful and accessible local AI assistant.

## How Can I Contribute?

There are many ways to contribute, whether it's with code, documentation, testing, or ideas:

*   **Reporting Bugs:** If you find a bug, please create an issue in our GitHub repository. Describe the bug, how to reproduce it, and your environment.
*   **Suggesting Enhancements:** Have an idea for a new feature or an improvement to an existing one? Open an issue to discuss it.
*   **Writing Code:** If you'd like to contribute code, please look for issues tagged "help wanted" or "good first issue." 
    *   Fork the repository.
    *   Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name` or `bugfix/issue-number`).
    *   Write clean, well-commented code that follows the project's style (see `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`).
    *   Write appropriate tests for your changes.
    *   Ensure all tests pass.
    *   Submit a pull request (PR) to the `main` branch.
*   **Improving Documentation:** Clear and comprehensive documentation is crucial. If you find areas for improvement in any of the `.md` files in the `docs/` directory or in code comments, please submit a PR.
*   **Testing:** Help test new features or upcoming releases. Provide feedback on usability and performance.
*   **Sharing Use Cases:** Let us know how you're using AVA! This helps us understand user needs and prioritize features.

## Development Setup

Please refer to `docs/INSTALLATION.md` for instructions on setting up your development environment and `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` for coding guidelines and project philosophy.

## Pull Request Process

1.  Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
2.  Update the `README.md` (both root and `docs/README.md` if applicable) with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
3.  Increase the version numbers in any examples and the `README.md` to the new version that this Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
4.  You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of at least one other developer, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the reviewer to merge it for you.
