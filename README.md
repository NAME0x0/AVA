## Overview

AVA (Afsah's Virtual Assistant) is an ambitious project to build a compact, yet highly capable, agentic AI model designed to run locally on modest consumer hardware, specifically targeting an **NVIDIA RTX A2000 GPU with 4GB VRAM**. 

The goal is to create a true "daily driver" AI assistant that can perform complex tasks, understand context, utilize tools, and provide a seamless user experience through both command-line and graphical interfaces, including remote access capabilities.

This repository contains all the code, documentation, and resources for Project AVA.

## Key Features & Goals

*   **Local First:** Runs entirely on your machine, ensuring privacy and data control.
*   **Optimized Performance:** Aggressively optimized for 4GB VRAM using 4-bit quantization, QLoRA, and knowledge distillation.
*   **Advanced Agentic Capabilities:** Function calling, tool use, structured output, and reasoning mechanisms.
*   **Direct Data Access:** Planned integration with Model Context Protocol (MCP) for real-time data interaction.
*   **User-Friendly Interfaces:** Both CLI and GUI (Open WebUI based) options.
*   **Remote Accessibility:** Securely access AVA's local inference server from other devices.

## Getting Started
