# AVA - Afsah's Virtual Assistant

---

Welcome to the **AVA** project! 🎉

AVA (Afsah's Virtual Assistant) is a personalized, AI-powered virtual assistant designed to automate various aspects of daily life. Inspired by the concept of JARVIS from Iron Man, AVA aims to serve as a sophisticated digital butler, helping with tasks, managing schedules, and providing an intelligent interface for automating workflows. This project is a step towards creating a robust, AI-driven ecosystem tailored for convenience and efficiency.
