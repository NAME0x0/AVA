# Integration specifics for Open WebUI with AVA

# This file is a placeholder for any Python-based glue code or specific configurations
# needed to enhance the integration of AVA (served via Ollama) with Open WebUI.

# In most standard scenarios, Open WebUI directly connects to Ollama's API endpoint,
# and model-specific configurations (like system prompts, parameters) are handled
# within Ollama's Modelfile and Open WebUI's settings for that model.

# Potential use cases for this file (if advanced integration is needed):
# 1.  Custom API endpoint: If AVA needs a custom FastAPI/Flask server that sits
#     between Open WebUI and Ollama to pre-process/post-process requests/responses
#     in a way Open WebUI or Ollama doesn't natively support for AVA's agentic features.
# 2.  Dynamic Configuration: Scripts to dynamically update Ollama Modelfiles for AVA
#     based on external factors or user settings not manageable through Open WebUI.
# 3.  Helper utilities for managing AVA within the Open WebUI context, e.g.,
#     scripts to register AVA models with specific tags to Ollama if not done manually.
